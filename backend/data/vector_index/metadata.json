The\ngreatest advances have occurred in the field of games playing. The best computer chess programs are now\ncapable of beating humans. Today, the hottest area of artificial intelligence is neural networks, which are\nproving successful in a number of disciplines such as voice recognition and natural-language processing.\nThere are several programming languages that are known as AI languages because they are used almost\nexclusively for AI applications. The two most common are LISP and Prolog. Artificial intelligence is working"

Due to\nthe infinite force of gravity in a black hole, a\nwormhole would collapse the moment it forms by\nsinking into the black hole. Furthermore, to stabilize\na wormhole, a substance known as “exotic matter”\ni.e., matter with a negative mass, energy and density,\nis required. Although this substance exists\nmathematically, it hasn’t been detected in the\nobservable universe (Tillman et al, 2022). However,\ncounter arguments have come forward in light of\nnew research suggesting that if there is a quantum\nconnection (Fig 3) between two black holes, “exotic\nmatter” may not be required to stabilize the tunnel. If\nsuch wormholes indeed do exist in black holes, then\nquantum information entering the black hole will be\nable to travel through the wormhole into another part\nof the universe, thereby solving the paradox of loss\nAccording to the current mining situation and the"

As the\nname suggests, white holes are fundamentall\nopposite to black holes. While it is impossible to\nescape from a black hole, it would be impossible to\nenter a white hole (Xiao, n.d.). Both white holes and\nblack holes look similar in nature when observed\nfrom space, however, the brief expulsion of matter is\nwhat differentiates the two. Viewing a white hole\nwould almost be like a “time reversal” of viewing a\nblack hole (Wood, 2022). However, white holes at\nbest can be called an impossible possibility, mainly\nbecause of two reasons. Firstly, for the existence ofa\nwhite hole on the other side of a black hole, a\nwormhole would be required to exist inside the black\nhole joining two regions of spacetime (Fig 4). As\nseen above, it is highly unlikely for such a theory to\nbe true. Secondly, white holes fail to obey the second\nlaw of thermodynamics —entropy (a measure of how\nmany different states particles in a system can be in)\nin the universe can either remain the same or it can\nincrease; however. computer programs to solve\ncomplex problems by applications of processes that\nare analogo\nbottoming scheme, it is preliminarily determined"

The\ngreatest advances have occurred in the field of games playing. The best computer chess programs are now\ncapable of beating humans. Today, the hottest area of artificial intelligence is neural networks, which are\nproving successful in a number of disciplines such as voice recognition and natural-language processing.\nThere are several programming languages that are known as AI languages because they are used almost\nexclusively for AI applications. The two most common are LISP and Prolog. Artificial intelligence is working"

Simply put,\nwormholes are tunnels connecting two different\nregions of space-time (Fig 2) (Darling, n.d.).\nAlthough scientists are still unaware about the\nimplications of the infinite curvature of spacetime in\na black hole, they seem to be able to provide the\nimmense forces of gravity required to curve space-\ntime into a tunnel, thereby making wormholes a\nplausible theory, but not one that is practical. Due to\nthe infinite force of gravity in a black hole, a\nwormhole would collapse the moment it forms by\nsinking into the black hole. Furthermore, to stabilize\na wormhole, a substance known as “exotic matter”\ni.e., matter with a negative mass, energy and density,\nis required. Although this substance exists\nmathematically, it hasn’t been detected in the\nobservable universe (Tillman et al, 2022). However,\ncounter arguments have come forward in light of\nnew research suggesting that if there is a quantum\nconnection (Fig 3) between two black holes, “exotic\nmatter” may not be required to stabilize the tunnel. If\nsuch wormholes indeed do exist in black holes, then\nquantum information entering the black hole will be\nable to travel through the wormhole into another part\nof the universe, thereby solving the paradox of loss\nAccording to the current mining situation and the"

As the\nname suggests, white holes are fundamentall\nopposite to black holes. While it is impossible to\nescape from a black hole, it would be impossible to\nenter a white hole (Xiao, n.d.). Both white holes and\nblack holes look similar in nature when observed\nfrom space, however, the brief expulsion of matter is\nwhat differentiates the two. Viewing a white hole\nwould almost be like a “time reversal” of viewing a\nblack hole (Wood, 2022). However, white holes at\nbest can be called an impossible possibility, mainly\nbecause of two reasons. Firstly, for the existence ofa\nwhite hole on the other side of a black hole, a\nwormhole would be required to exist inside the black\nhole joining two regions of spacetime (Fig 4). As\nseen above, it is highly unlikely for such a theory to\nbe true. Secondly, white holes fail to obey the second\nlaw of thermodynamics —entropy (a measure of how\nmany different states particles in a system can be in)\nin the universe can either remain the same or it can\nincrease; however. computer programs to solve\ncomplex problems by applications of processes that\nare analogo\nbottoming scheme, it is preliminarily determined"

The\ngreatest advances have occurred in the field of games playing. The best computer chess programs are now\ncapable of beating humans. Today, the hottest area of artificial intelligence is neural networks, which are\nproving successful in a number of disciplines such as voice recognition and natural-language processing.\nThere are several programming languages that are known as AI languages because they are used almost\nexclusively for AI applications. The two most common are LISP and Prolog. Artificial intelligence is working"

Simply put,\nwormholes are tunnels connecting two different\nregions of space-time (Fig 2) (Darling, n.d.).\nAlthough scientists are still unaware about the\nimplications of the infinite curvature of spacetime in\na black hole, they seem to be able to provide the\nimmense forces of gravity required to curve space-\ntime into a tunnel, thereby making wormholes a\nplausible theory, but not one that is practical. Due to\nthe infinite force of gravity in a black hole, a\nwormhole would collapse the moment it forms by\nsinking into the black hole. Furthermore, to stabilize\na wormhole, a substance known as “exotic matter”\ni.e., matter with a negative mass, energy and density,\nis required. Although this substance exists\nmathematically, it hasn’t been detected in the\nobservable universe (Tillman et al, 2022). However,\ncounter arguments have come forward in light of\nnew research suggesting that if there is a quantum\nconnection (Fig 3) between two black holes, “exotic\nmatter” may not be required to stabilize the tunnel. If\nsuch wormholes indeed do exist in black holes, then\nquantum information entering the black hole will be\nable to travel through the wormhole into another part\nof the universe, thereby solving the paradox of loss\nAccording to the current mining situation and the"

As the\nname suggests, white holes are fundamentall\nopposite to black holes. While it is impossible to\nescape from a black hole, it would be impossible to\nenter a white hole (Xiao, n.d.). Both white holes and\nblack holes look similar in nature when observed\nfrom space, however, the brief expulsion of matter is\nwhat differentiates the two. Viewing a white hole\nwould almost be like a “time reversal” of viewing a\nblack hole (Wood, 2022). However, white holes at\nbest can be called an impossible possibility, mainly\nbecause of two reasons. Firstly, for the existence ofa\nwhite hole on the other side of a black hole, a\nwormhole would be required to exist inside the black\nhole joining two regions of spacetime (Fig 4). As\nseen above, it is highly unlikely for such a theory to\nbe true. Secondly, white holes fail to obey the second\nlaw of thermodynamics —entropy (a measure of how\nmany different states particles in a system can be in)\nin the universe can either remain the same or it can\nincrease; however. computer programs to solve\ncomplex problems by applications of processes that\nare analogo\nbottoming scheme, it is preliminarily determined"

The\ngreatest advances have occurred in the field of games playing. The best computer chess programs are now\ncapable of beating humans. Today, the hottest area of artificial intelligence is neural networks, which are\nproving successful in a number of disciplines such as voice recognition and natural-language processing.\nThere are several programming languages that are known as AI languages because they are used almost\nexclusively for AI applications. The two most common are LISP and Prolog. Artificial intelligence is working"

Simply put,\nwormholes are tunnels connecting two different\nregions of space-time (Fig 2) (Darling, n.d.).\nAlthough scientists are still unaware about the\nimplications of the infinite curvature of spacetime in\na black hole, they seem to be able to provide the\nimmense forces of gravity required to curve space-\ntime into a tunnel, thereby making wormholes a\nplausible theory, but not one that is practical. Due to\nthe infinite force of gravity in a black hole, a\nwormhole would collapse the moment it forms by\nsinking into the black hole. Furthermore, to stabilize\na wormhole, a substance known as “exotic matter”\ni.e., matter with a negative mass, energy and density,\nis required. Although this substance exists\nmathematically, it hasn’t been detected in the\nobservable universe (Tillman et al, 2022). However,\ncounter arguments have come forward in light of\nnew research suggesting that if there is a quantum\nconnection (Fig 3) between two black holes, “exotic\nmatter” may not be required to stabilize the tunnel. If\nsuch wormholes indeed do exist in black holes, then\nquantum information entering the black hole will be\nable to travel through the wormhole into another part\nof the universe, thereby solving the paradox of loss\nAccording to the current mining situation and the"

The\ngreatest advances have occurred in the field of games playing. The best computer chess programs are now\ncapable of beating humans. Today, the hottest area of artificial intelligence is neural networks, which are\nproving successful in a number of disciplines such as voice recognition and natural-language processing.\nThere are several programming languages that are known as AI languages because they are used almost\nexclusively for AI applications. The two most common are LISP and Prolog. Artificial intelligence is working"

Simply put,\nwormholes are tunnels connecting two different\nregions of space-time (Fig 2) (Darling, n.d.).\nAlthough scientists are still unaware about the\nimplications of the infinite curvature of spacetime in\na black hole, they seem to be able to provide the\nimmense forces of gravity required to curve space-\ntime into a tunnel, thereby making wormholes a\nplausible theory, but not one that is practical. Due to\nthe infinite force of gravity in a black hole, a\nwormhole would collapse the moment it forms by\nsinking into the black hole.

But is that the only goal in the\nfuture? Research is centered on bho s adike\nconstructing human-like machines or robots. This\nis because scientists are concerned in human\nintelligence and are awestruck by trying to copy\nit. If machines ma a k e la v de start doing the\nwork done by humans then, the role of humans\nwill definitely change.

The\ngreatest advances have occurred in the field of games playing. The best computer chess programs are now\ncapable of beating humans. Today, the hottest area of artificial intelligence is neural networks, which are\nproving successful in a number of disciplines such as voice recognition and natural-language processing.\nThere are several programming languages that are known as AI languages because they are used almost\nexclusively for AI applications. The two most common are LISP and Prolog. Artificial intelligence is working"

Simply put,\nwormholes are tunnels connecting two different\nregions of space-time (Fig 2) (Darling, n.d.).\nAlthough scientists are still unaware about the\nimplications of the infinite curvature of spacetime in\na black hole, they seem to be able to provide the\nimmense forces of gravity required to curve space-\ntime into a tunnel, thereby making wormholes a\nplausible theory, but not one that is practical. Due to\nthe infinite force of gravity in a black hole, a\nwormhole would collapse the moment it forms by\nsinking into the black hole. Furthermore, to stabilize\na wormhole, a substance known as “exotic matter”\ni.e., matter with a negative mass, energy and density,\nis required. Although this substance exists\nmathematically, it hasn’t been detected in the\nobservable universe (Tillman et al, 2022). However,\ncounter arguments have come forward in light of\nnew research suggesting that if there is a quantum\nconnection (Fig 3) between two black holes, “exotic\nmatter” may not be required to stabilize the tunnel. If\nsuch wormholes indeed do exist in black holes, then\nquantum information entering the black hole will be\nable to travel through the wormhole into another part\nof the universe, thereby solving the paradox of loss\nAccording to the current mining situation and the"

As the\nname suggests, white holes are fundamentall\nopposite to black holes. While it is impossible to\nescape from a black hole, it would be impossible to\nenter a white hole (Xiao, n.d.). Both white holes and\nblack holes look similar in nature when observed\nfrom space, however, the brief expulsion of matter is\nwhat differentiates the two. Viewing a white hole\nwould almost be like a “time reversal” of viewing a\nblack hole (Wood, 2022). However, white holes at\nbest can be called an impossible possibility, mainly\nbecause of two reasons. Firstly, for the existence ofa\nwhite hole on the other side of a black hole, a\nwormhole would be required to exist inside the black\nhole joining two regions of spacetime (Fig 4). As\nseen above, it is highly unlikely for such a theory to\nbe true. Secondly, white holes fail to obey the second\nlaw of thermodynamics —entropy (a measure of how\nmany different states particles in a system can be in)\nin the universe can either remain the same or it can\nincrease; however. computer programs to solve\ncomplex problems by applications of processes that\nare analogo\nbottoming scheme, it is preliminarily determined"

    "text": "Learning is defined as “the process of a change and enhancement in the behaviours through\nexploring new information in time” by Simon. When the “learning” in this definition is\nperformed by the machines, it is called machine learning. The term enhancement is creating\nthe best solution based on the existing experiences and samples during machine learning\nprocess (Sirma¢ek, 2007). As a result of the developments in information technologies, the\nterm ‘big data’ has emerged. The term ‘big data’ is not a new concept and can be defined as\nenormous and accumulating raw data sets which have no limits and cannot be analysed by the\ntraditional database techniques (Altunisik, 2015). Enormous data are collected from the\nInternet applications, ATMs, credit card swiping machines and etc. The information collected\nby this way is waiting to be analysed. The aim of analysing the data collected in different\nfields change in accordance with the business sector. Machine learning applications are used\nin some fields like natural language processing, image processing and computer vision,\nspeech and handwriting recognition, automotive, aviation, production, generation of energy,\ncalculated finance and biology. However, the aim is based on the principle of analysing and\ninterpretation of the previous data. As it is impossible to analyse and interpret by human,\nmachine learning methods and algorithms have been developed to do this (Amasyali, 2008)."

    "text": "In 1940s, based on the studies on the electrical crashes of the neurons, the scientists explained\nthe decision-making mechanism of human by cannon and fire. In this way, the researches of\nthe artificial intelligence started in the 1950s (Erdem, 2014). In those years, Alan Turin\nexecuted the Turing Test in order to test the ability of a machine to imitate a human. The aim\nof the Turing Test was to measure the ability of the machine to make a contact with a human\nduring an interview. If the machine performed worse than a human, it was successful. In\n1956, the term ‘artificial intelligence’ was first used in a summer school held by Marvin\nMinsky from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, John McCarthy from Stanford\nUniversity and Allen Newell and Herbert Simon from Carnegie-Mellon University. Until that\ntime, Alan Turing’s term, ‘machine intelligence’, had been used. In 1959, Arthur Samul\ncreated the checkers programme, and then machine learning got its way. From those\ndevelopments to the 1980s, there were some studies on abstract mind, information-based\nsystems, which was called the ‘winter of artificial intelligence’. In the 1990s, artificial\nintelligence and machine learning studies accelerated due to the developments in game\ntechnologies. Nowadays, artificial intelligence and machine learning are used in lots of\nresearches and work sectors (Topal, 2017)"

In such cases,\nselecting a subgroup of features or getting new features combining the features is called\ndeduction of features (Erdem, 2014).\nSemi-supervised Learning: supervised and unsupervised learning is inadequate when the\nlabelled data are less than unlabelled data. In such cases, the unlabelled data, which are very\ninadequate, is used to deduce information about them. And, this method is called semi-\nsupervised learning. The difference between the semi-supervised learning and the supervised\nlearning is the labelled data set. In supervised learning, the labelled data are more than the\ndata to be predicted. In contrast, in semi-supervised learning, the labelled data are less than\nthe data to be predicted (Kizilkaya ve Oguzlar, 2018).\nReinforcement Learning: This is a kind of learning in which the agents learn via reward\nsystem. Although there is a start and finish points, the aim of the agent is to use the shortest\nand the correct ways to reach the goal. When the agent goes through the correct ways, s/he is\ngiven positive rewards. But the going through wrong ways means negative rewards. Learning\noccurs on the way to the goal (Sirmacek, 2007)."

The groups are shown like -1 and 1 or 0 and 1. During the learning process, both the\nweights and the weights of threshold value are updated. The output value of the threshold\nvalue is 1. Since the single layer artificial neural networks are inefficient for the nonlinear\nproblems, multilayer artificial neural networks have been developed.

At the same\ntime, in the feedforward networks, the output values of the cells in one layer are transmitted to\nthe following layers as the inputs on the weights. The input layer sends the input to the hidden\nlayer without making any change. Once this information is processed on the hidden and the\noutput layer, its output on the network is determined.

Ancak 1990’h yillarda tekrar gelisme géstererek galigmalara baslanmis ve giiniimiize kadar ulasmustir.\nBundan sonraki zamanlarda daha da gelisecek bir bilim dali olacaktir. Bunun nedeni de hizla artan veri miktarimin (biiyiik\nveri — big data) analizinin ve islenmesinin insan eliyle yapilamayacak olmasindan kaynaklanmaktadir. Makine 6grenmesi,\nartmakta olan bu veriler sayesinde gegmisteki verilerden yeni veriler igin en uygun modeli bulma prensibine\ndayanmaktadir. Bu yiizden giin gegtikge makine 6grenmesi galismalar1 da artan veriyle dogru orantili olarak geliserek\ndevam edecektir. Bu galismada da makine 6grenmesinin tarih¢esi, makine 6grenmesinde kullanilan y6ntemler, uygulama\nalanlari ve yapilan galigsmalar hakkinda bilgiler verilmistir. Bu ¢galigsmanin amaci giiniimiizde daha da popiiler bir hale\ngelen makine 6grenmesi konusunun ve uygulamalarinin arastirmacilara aktarilmasim saglamaktir."

    "text": "Learning is defined as “the process of a change and enhancement in the behaviours through\nexploring new information in time” by Simon. When the “learning” in this definition is\nperformed by the machines, it is called machine learning. The term enhancement is creating\nthe best solution based on the existing experiences and samples during machine learning\nprocess (Sirma¢ek, 2007). As a result of the developments in information technologies, the\nterm ‘big data’ has emerged. The term ‘big data’ is not a new concept and can be defined as\nenormous and accumulating raw data sets which have no limits and cannot be analysed by the\ntraditional database techniques (Altunisik, 2015). Enormous data are collected from the\nInternet applications, ATMs, credit card swiping machines and etc. The information collected\nby this way is waiting to be analysed. The aim of analysing the data collected in different\nfields change in accordance with the business sector. Machine learning applications are used\nin some fields like natural language processing, image processing and computer vision,\nspeech and handwriting recognition, automotive, aviation, production, generation of energy,\ncalculated finance and biology. However, the aim is based on the principle of analysing and\ninterpretation of the previous data. As it is impossible to analyse and interpret by human,\nmachine learning methods and algorithms have been developed to do this (Amasyali, 2008)."

    "text": "In 1940s, based on the studies on the electrical crashes of the neurons, the scientists explained\nthe decision-making mechanism of human by cannon and fire. In this way, the researches of\nthe artificial intelligence started in the 1950s (Erdem, 2014). In those years, Alan Turin\nexecuted the Turing Test in order to test the ability of a machine to imitate a human. The aim\nof the Turing Test was to measure the ability of the machine to make a contact with a human\nduring an interview. If the machine performed worse than a human, it was successful. In\n1956, the term ‘artificial intelligence’ was first used in a summer school held by Marvin\nMinsky from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, John McCarthy from Stanford\nUniversity and Allen Newell and Herbert Simon from Carnegie-Mellon University. Until that\ntime, Alan Turing’s term, ‘machine intelligence’, had been used. In 1959, Arthur Samul\ncreated the checkers programme, and then machine learning got its way. From those\ndevelopments to the 1980s, there were some studies on abstract mind, information-based\nsystems, which was called the ‘winter of artificial intelligence’. In the 1990s, artificial\nintelligence and machine learning studies accelerated due to the developments in game\ntechnologies. Nowadays, artificial intelligence and machine learning are used in lots of\nresearches and work sectors (Topal, 2017)"

In such cases,\nselecting a subgroup of features or getting new features combining the features is called\ndeduction of features (Erdem, 2014).\nSemi-supervised Learning: supervised and unsupervised learning is inadequate when the\nlabelled data are less than unlabelled data. In such cases, the unlabelled data, which are very\ninadequate, is used to deduce information about them. And, this method is called semi-\nsupervised learning. The difference between the semi-supervised learning and the supervised\nlearning is the labelled data set. In supervised learning, the labelled data are more than the\ndata to be predicted. In contrast, in semi-supervised learning, the labelled data are less than\nthe data to be predicted (Kizilkaya ve Oguzlar, 2018).\nReinforcement Learning: This is a kind of learning in which the agents learn via reward\nsystem. Although there is a start and finish points, the aim of the agent is to use the shortest\nand the correct ways to reach the goal. When the agent goes through the correct ways, s/he is\ngiven positive rewards. But the going through wrong ways means negative rewards. Learning\noccurs on the way to the goal (Sirmacek, 2007)."

Once the variable, which is the source of the question, is\ndetermined, this variable creates the root node of the tree. The test to be applied is determined\nby the root node. At the end of the test, the tree is divided into branches and the separation\nprocess follow the test. Each of the branches on the are candidates for classification process.\nIf there is a classification at the end of a branch, a leaf emerges at the end of the branch. The\nleaf is the one of the desired groups in the data. If there is no classification process at the end\nof the branch, there emerges a decision node on this branch.

While the model\nbecomes successful for the sample data, it can make mistakes with the new data. It occurs\nwhen there is too much information to be classified or noisy data in the dataset. Pruning is the\nprocess of cutting the branches which are formed by the noisy data and which leads to\nmistakes. The pruning process has two types: pre-pruning and post-pruning. Generally, post-\npruning is preferred. In this process, determined branches are cut or two different branches are\ncombined and cut after the whole tree has been created till the leaves by using the whole data.\nAt the end of the pruning process the tree gets smaller with less error margins\n(Haciefendioglu, 2012).\nWidely used various decision tree methods are given in the following table:"

The main principle of SVM is based on finding the hyperplane which\nseparates the data of two classes the most appropriately.

    "text": "Learning is defined as “the process of a change and enhancement in the behaviours through\nexploring new information in time” by Simon. When the “learning” in this definition is\nperformed by the machines, it is called machine learning. The term enhancement is creating\nthe best solution based on the existing experiences and samples during machine learning\nprocess (Sirma¢ek, 2007). As a result of the developments in information technologies, the\nterm ‘big data’ has emerged. The term ‘big data’ is not a new concept and can be defined as\nenormous and accumulating raw data sets which have no limits and cannot be analysed by the\ntraditional database techniques (Altunisik, 2015). Enormous data are collected from the\nInternet applications, ATMs, credit card swiping machines and etc. The information collected\nby this way is waiting to be analysed. The aim of analysing the data collected in different\nfields change in accordance with the business sector. Machine learning applications are used\nin some fields like natural language processing, image processing and computer vision,\nspeech and handwriting recognition, automotive, aviation, production, generation of energy,\ncalculated finance and biology. However, the aim is based on the principle of analysing and\ninterpretation of the previous data. As it is impossible to analyse and interpret by human,\nmachine learning methods and algorithms have been developed to do this (Amasyali, 2008)."

    "text": "In 1940s, based on the studies on the electrical crashes of the neurons, the scientists explained\nthe decision-making mechanism of human by cannon and fire. In this way, the researches of\nthe artificial intelligence started in the 1950s (Erdem, 2014). In those years, Alan Turin\nexecuted the Turing Test in order to test the ability of a machine to imitate a human. The aim\nof the Turing Test was to measure the ability of the machine to make a contact with a human\nduring an interview. If the machine performed worse than a human, it was successful. In\n1956, the term ‘artificial intelligence’ was first used in a summer school held by Marvin\nMinsky from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, John McCarthy from Stanford\nUniversity and Allen Newell and Herbert Simon from Carnegie-Mellon University. Until that\ntime, Alan Turing’s term, ‘machine intelligence’, had been used. In 1959, Arthur Samul\ncreated the checkers programme, and then machine learning got its way. From those\ndevelopments to the 1980s, there were some studies on abstract mind, information-based\nsystems, which was called the ‘winter of artificial intelligence’. In the 1990s, artificial\nintelligence and machine learning studies accelerated due to the developments in game\ntechnologies. Nowadays, artificial intelligence and machine learning are used in lots of\nresearches and work sectors (Topal, 2017)"

In such cases,\nselecting a subgroup of features or getting new features combining the features is called\ndeduction of features (Erdem, 2014).\nSemi-supervised Learning: supervised and unsupervised learning is inadequate when the\nlabelled data are less than unlabelled data. In such cases, the unlabelled data, which are very\ninadequate, is used to deduce information about them. And, this method is called semi-\nsupervised learning. The difference between the semi-supervised learning and the supervised\nlearning is the labelled data set. In supervised learning, the labelled data are more than the\ndata to be predicted. In contrast, in semi-supervised learning, the labelled data are less than\nthe data to be predicted (Kizilkaya ve Oguzlar, 2018).\nReinforcement Learning: This is a kind of learning in which the agents learn via reward\nsystem. Although there is a start and finish points, the aim of the agent is to use the shortest\nand the correct ways to reach the goal. When the agent goes through the correct ways, s/he is\ngiven positive rewards. But the going through wrong ways means negative rewards. Learning\noccurs on the way to the goal (Sirmacek, 2007)."

The main principle of SVM is based on finding the hyperplane which\nseparates the data of two classes the most appropriately.

    "text": "The k-nearest neighbours algorithm developed by Fix and Hodges in 1951 is based on the\nlogic that the variables which are closest to each other belong to the same class. The main\npurpose is to classify the new incoming data in accordance with the previously categorized\ndata. Data whose class is not known is called a 'test sample' and previously classified data is\ncalled 'learning samples'. In the K-NN algorithm, the distance from the test sample to the\nlearning samples is calculated and then the closest k learning instances are selected. The\nmajority of the selected k samples are used to determine their class; it is also decided that the\ntest sample belongs to that class (Ozkan, 2013)."

    "text": "Learning is defined as “the process of a change and enhancement in the behaviours through\nexploring new information in time” by Simon. When the “learning” in this definition is\nperformed by the machines, it is called machine learning. The term enhancement is creating\nthe best solution based on the existing experiences and samples during machine learning\nprocess (Sirma¢ek, 2007). As a result of the developments in information technologies, the\nterm ‘big data’ has emerged. The term ‘big data’ is not a new concept and can be defined as\nenormous and accumulating raw data sets which have no limits and cannot be analysed by the\ntraditional database techniques (Altunisik, 2015). Enormous data are collected from the\nInternet applications, ATMs, credit card swiping machines and etc. The information collected\nby this way is waiting to be analysed. The aim of analysing the data collected in different\nfields change in accordance with the business sector. Machine learning applications are used\nin some fields like natural language processing, image processing and computer vision,\nspeech and handwriting recognition, automotive, aviation, production, generation of energy,\ncalculated finance and biology. However, the aim is based on the principle of analysing and\ninterpretation of the previous data. As it is impossible to analyse and interpret by human,\nmachine learning methods and algorithms have been developed to do this (Amasyali, 2008)."

    "text": "In 1940s, based on the studies on the electrical crashes of the neurons, the scientists explained\nthe decision-making mechanism of human by cannon and fire. In this way, the researches of\nthe artificial intelligence started in the 1950s (Erdem, 2014). In those years, Alan Turin\nexecuted the Turing Test in order to test the ability of a machine to imitate a human. The aim\nof the Turing Test was to measure the ability of the machine to make a contact with a human\nduring an interview. If the machine performed worse than a human, it was successful. In\n1956, the term ‘artificial intelligence’ was first used in a summer school held by Marvin\nMinsky from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, John McCarthy from Stanford\nUniversity and Allen Newell and Herbert Simon from Carnegie-Mellon University. Until that\ntime, Alan Turing’s term, ‘machine intelligence’, had been used. In 1959, Arthur Samul\ncreated the checkers programme, and then machine learning got its way. From those\ndevelopments to the 1980s, there were some studies on abstract mind, information-based\nsystems, which was called the ‘winter of artificial intelligence’. In the 1990s, artificial\nintelligence and machine learning studies accelerated due to the developments in game\ntechnologies. Nowadays, artificial intelligence and machine learning are used in lots of\nresearches and work sectors (Topal, 2017)"

In such cases,\nselecting a subgroup of features or getting new features combining the features is called\ndeduction of features (Erdem, 2014).\nSemi-supervised Learning: supervised and unsupervised learning is inadequate when the\nlabelled data are less than unlabelled data. In such cases, the unlabelled data, which are very\ninadequate, is used to deduce information about them. And, this method is called semi-\nsupervised learning. The difference between the semi-supervised learning and the supervised\nlearning is the labelled data set. In supervised learning, the labelled data are more than the\ndata to be predicted. In contrast, in semi-supervised learning, the labelled data are less than\nthe data to be predicted (Kizilkaya ve Oguzlar, 2018).\nReinforcement Learning: This is a kind of learning in which the agents learn via reward\nsystem. Although there is a start and finish points, the aim of the agent is to use the shortest\nand the correct ways to reach the goal. When the agent goes through the correct ways, s/he is\ngiven positive rewards. But the going through wrong ways means negative rewards. Learning\noccurs on the way to the goal (Sirmacek, 2007)."

In some neural network models, it is must for the activation function to be\nderivable. Calculating the derivative is important for the learning process of the network.\nThus, the derivation of the sigmoid function is the most commonly used function because it\ncan be written in the function itself. It is not compulsory to use the same activation function in\nall the cells. They can have different activation functions. Activation functions are as follows:\nlinear function, sigmoid function, hyperbolic tangent function, sine function, digit function.\nOutput: This is the value which is determined by the activation value. The last output\nproduced can both be sent to the other cells or to the outer world. If there is a feedback, the\ncell may use the output as an input by this feedback (Haciefendioglu, 2012)."

The most important feature of the network is classification of the problems which\ncan be selected linear as a layer. After the inputs in the problem are multiplied by the weights\nand added, the calculated values are classified according to their threshold value as high or\nlow. The groups are shown like -1 and 1 or 0 and 1. During the learning process, both the\nweights and the weights of threshold value are updated. The output value of the threshold\nvalue is 1. Since the single layer artificial neural networks are inefficient for the nonlinear\nproblems, multilayer artificial neural networks have been developed.

    "text": "Along with the developments in the technology in recent years, machines have had a big role\nin our lives. There are a lot of data gathered in every part of our lives and these data are\nincreasing day by day. Thanks to the machines, these data are used very efficiently. Although\nthese machines are thought to be used only in the fields of engineering and computer science,\nthey are encountered at every part of human life. Firms that have already recognized and\ninvested on this area are using this technology actively today and achieving success. In the\nfuture, machines that will be successful in the jobs that cannot be done by human will affect\nlots of business sectors and people. Some of the known business areas will become extinct\nand some new business areas will emerge. In such an environment, the power of information\ntechnology and machines must be strictly taken into consideration."

Makine\n6grenmesinin ilk adimlar 1950°li yillarda atilmis olup uzun bir siire gézle gériiliir galismalar yapilmamius ve gelisme\ngosterememistir. Ancak 1990’h yillarda tekrar gelisme géstererek galigmalara baslanmis ve giiniimiize kadar ulasmustir.\nBundan sonraki zamanlarda daha da gelisecek bir bilim dali olacaktir. Bunun nedeni de hizla artan veri miktarimin (biiyiik\nveri — big data) analizinin ve islenmesinin insan eliyle yapilamayacak olmasindan kaynaklanmaktadir. Makine 6grenmesi,\nartmakta olan bu veriler sayesinde gegmisteki verilerden yeni veriler igin en uygun modeli bulma prensibine\ndayanmaktadir.

Normally this type of motor\nconsists of a control circuit that provides feedback on the current position of the motor shaft, this\nfeedback allows the servo motors to rotate with great precision. If you want to rotate an object at\nsome specific angles or distance, then you use a servo motor. It is just made up of a simple motor\nwhich runs through a servo mechanism. If motor is powered by a DC power supply then it is\ncalled DC servo motor, and if it is AC-powered motor then it is called AC servo motor. For this\ntutorial, we will be discussing only about the DC servo motor working. Apart from these major\nclassifications, there are many other types of servo motors based on the type of gear arrangement\nand operating characteristics. A servo motor usually comes with a gear arrangement that allows us\nto get a very high torque servo motor in small and lightweight packages. Due to these features,"

    "text": "Dominant white is a commonly observed coat color phe-\nnotype in a variety of mammalian species, such as white\nFranches-Montagnes horses and Landrace and Yorkshire\nwhite pig breeds [1-3]. The dominant white phenotype\nin domestic pigs is mainly determined by two mutations\nin KIT — a duplication and a splice mutation [4, 5]. The\nduplication mutation is an approximately 560-kb tan-\ndem duplication that encompasses the entire KJT gene\nand its upstream and downstream regulatory regions,\nwhereas the splice mutation is a G>A substitution at\nthe first nucleotide of intron 17 in at least one of the KIT\ncopies. The splice mutation causes skipping of exon 17,\neading to the production of a KIT protein with impaired\ntyrosine kinase activity [4-6]. The KIT gene is a typical\nroto-oncogene that contains 21 exons located on chro-\nmosomes 4, 5 and 8 in humans, mice and pigs, respec-\ntively [7-9]. The KIT protein is a member of the class\nIII receptor tyrosine kinase family and consists of three\nrincipal functional domains: the extracellular immuno-\nglobulin-like domain, which is crucial for ligand binding;\nthe transmembrane domain, which facilitates protein\nanchoring within the cell membrane; and the intracel-\nlular domain, which includes the tyrosine kinase activity\nessential for signal transduction [10-12]. The SCF/KIT\ninteraction leads to receptor dimerization and the acti-\nvation of kinase activity. This initiates a cascade of signal\ntransduction pathways that are crucial for regulating cell\nproliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and migration,\nincluding the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), Src,\nJanus kinase/signal transducers and activators of tran-\nscription (JAK/STAT), phospholipase-C (PLC-y) and\nmitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways [13].\nMAPK pathways have been described at multiple levels\nin distinct biological processes; however, much has yet to\nbe discovered about the relationship between SCF/KIT\nand the MAPK pathway in spermatogenesis."

In mice, Kit mutations\ncan lead to modifications in coat color, anemia and male\nsterility [10]. Furthermore, studies have shown that, com-\npared with Duroc pigs, dominant white pigs (Yorkshire\npigs or Landrace pigs) present smaller testes, reduced\nsperm motility and lower sperm density [17-19]. These\nfindings suggest that structural mutations in KIT may be\nimportant factors influencing porcine testicular develop-\nment and spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis is a highly\ncomplex and conserved process of cell division and dif-\nferentiation that includes the proliferation and differen-\ntiation of spermatogonia, the meiosis of spermatocytes\nand the formation of spermatozoa [7].

    "text": "Among all the genes with altered expression pro-\nfiles in the testicular tissues of Kit ?!”* mice, 435 genes\nwere upregulated (approximately 73%) and 162 genes\nwere downregulated (27%) in 5 W-D17 compared with\n5 W-W'T, whereas in 7 W-D17, 2073 genes were upreg-\nulated (97.5%) and 53 genes were downregulated (2.5%)\ncompared with 7 W-WT (Fig. S2B). When the DEGs for\n5 W and 7 W (5 W-WT vs. 5 W-D17 and 7 W-WT vs.\n7 W-D17) were subjected to GO analysis, we observed\nthat downregulated genes in both age groups predomi-\nnantly participated in the processes of reproduction,\nspermatogenesis and meiosis (Fig. 5A and B), which was\nconsistent with the impaired spermatogenesis and dif-\nferentiation observed in Kit °!”* mice. The upregulated\ngenes were associated primarily with key biological pro-\ncesses such as cell adhesion, the extracellular matrix and\ncell motility (Fig. 5C and D). We further focused on the\ndownregulated genes associated with spermatogenesis.\nWe enriched a total of 17 genes related to spermatogen-\nesis, including 10 genes with known specific functions,\nsuch as the double-stranded DNA break repair-related\ngenes Msh4, Mlh3, and Zcwpw1; the meiotic homolo-\ngous recombination-related genes Dmc1, Meiob and Hor-\nmad1; and the meiosis-related genes Tex12, Ccnblip1,\nMajin, and H2ax (Fig. 5E and F). The RNA-seq data were\nconfirmed via RT-qPCR of 6 genes (Sycp3, Dmcl, Cen-\nblip1, Msh4, Meiob and Hormad1) known to be involved\nin spermatogenesis (Fig. 5G-L). Overall, our transcrip-\ntomic analysis revealed the critical role of exon 17 of the\nKit gene in the regulation of spermatogenesis."

Therefore, we speculated that the\ndifference in spermatogonia differentiation between Kit\nPI7/* and Kit *!* mice may be related to the MAPK sig-\nnaling pathway. To verify whether deletion of exon 17\naffects spermatogenesis via the MAPK cascade, west-\nern blotting was performed to determine the expression\nof downstream factors of the MAPK signaling pathway.\nThe deletion of exon 17 led to a truncated intracellular\nkinase domain in the KIT protein, which we speculated\nmay affect the phosphorylation level of KIT; therefore,\nwe first examined the self-phosphorylation function of\nKIT. The results showed that there was no significant\nchange in the expression of total KIT protein in testicu-\nlar tissues between Kit ?!”* and Kit */* mice (Fig. 6B\nand C), whereas the expression of phosphorylated KIT\ndecreased significantly in Kit ?!”* mice (Fig. 6B and D)."

Previous studies have indicated that, compared\nwith Duroc pigs, dominant white pigs (Yorkshire pigs\nor Landrace pigs) exhibit smaller testes, reduced sperm\nmotility and lower sperm density [17-19]. Through\nanalysis of a mouse model with heterozygous deletion of\nexon 17 of Kit, we found that the splice mutation caused\na range of reproductive phenotypic traits, including a\nsmaller testis and epididymis and poor sperm quality and\nreproductive ability (Figs. 1 and 2), which are similar to\nthe phenotype observed in dominant white pig breeds.\nTherefore, we consider that the less developed testes and\nlower sperm quality of the dominant white pigs should be\nattributed mainly to the splice mutation in KIT."

    "text": "The MAPK signaling pathway is activated by a variety\nof cell surface receptors and plays important roles in vari-\nous cellular processes [33]. KIT-mediated cell signaling\ncan activate multiple MAPKs, including extracellular-\nsignal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, p38, c-Jun N-terminal\nkinase (JNK), and ERK5 [7, 34, 35]. Through transcrip-\ntomic analysis and western blot analysis, we found that\nthe splice mutation of Kit impaired MAPK signaling\nfunctions, as evidenced by attenuated ERK1/2 signaling\n(Fig. 6B-I), which ultimately led to the downregulation\nof many genes involved in meiosis and spermatogenesis.\nThese findings could provide new insights into the regu-\nlatory role of the splice mutation of KIT of spermatogen-\nesis in dominant pigs."

    "text": "Reproductive traits, including litter size and semen\nquality, are complex traits controlled by multiple gene\nregulatory pathways [36]. Although there is no direct\nexample of improved semen quality through gene editing\ntechnology, one recent study has shown that gene edit-\ning has the potential to increase sperm quality in ani-\nmals [37]. In one study, MSTN-edited cattle were created\nvia CRISPR/Cas9, and the sperm motility parameters,\nincluding WOB (wobble) and BCF (beat cross-frequency)\nof the gene-edited cattle were significantly greater than\nthose of their wild-type counterparts [37]. Therefore,\nwe propose that correction of the splice mutation of\nKIT in dominant white pigs through gene editing tech-\nnology, such as base editing, would restore the impaired\nKIT signaling functions involved in spermatogenesis and\nimprove the semen quality of Yorkshire or Landrace pigs."

These findings could provide a theoretical basis for\nimproving the semen quality of dominant white pigs\nthrough correction of the splice mutation of KIT using\ngene editing technology."
